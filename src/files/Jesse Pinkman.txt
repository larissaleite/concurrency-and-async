Jesse Pinkman
Summary:
Jesse Bruce Pinkman is a fictional character in the television series Breaking Bad, played by Aaron Paul. He is a crystal meth cook and dealer, and works with his former high school chemistry teacher, Walter White (Bryan Cranston), in a meth operation. Jesse is the only character besides Walt to appear in every episode of the show. Paul reprised the role for the 2019 spin-off film El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, a sequel to the series set after the events of the show's series finale.

Despite plans to kill off the character at the end of the first season, Paul's performance convinced the showrunner and head writer Vince Gilligan to keep Jesse in the show. The character and Paul's performance have received acclaim from critics and fans. Critics especially praised Jesse's character development from an unsympathetic drug dealer to the moral compass of the show as he becomes increasingly guilty and remorseful for his and Walter White's actions, while involved in the drug trade.[1] For his portrayal, Paul won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014â€”which makes him one of two actors to win the category three times since its separation into drama and comedy, along with Peter Dinklage.

Jesse Bruce Pinkman[2] was born into an upper middle-class family in Albuquerque, New Mexico. At the time the series starts, he has long been estranged from his parents due to his drug abuse and lifestyle as a drug dealer. After being forced to leave his parents' residence, Jesse moved in with his Aunt Ginny, for whom he cared until her death from cancer. Afterward, he was allowed to stay in her home, the ownership of which fell to Jesse's parents.

Jesse was a poor student in high school and preferred hanging out with his friends and smoking marijuana to studying. Walt, whom Jesse almost always calls "Mr. White", was his chemistry teacher and failed Jesse in his class. Walt himself later says that he never thought Jesse would amount to much,[3] although Jesse's mother (Tess Harper) recalls that Walt "must have seen some potential in Jesse; he really tried to motivate him. He was one of the few teachers who cared."[4] Despite his poor academic standing, Jesse was able to graduate, with Walt present on stage when he received his diploma.[5]

When Walt is diagnosed with cancer and considers making methamphetamine to provide an income for his family, he tries to learn the illegal drug business by accompanying his brother-in-law Hank Schrader, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, on a ridealong. During a drug bust, he spots Jesse running away from the scene but Jesse's partner Emilio Koyama (John Koyama) is arrested. Walt subsequently realizes that Jesse is "Cap'n Cook", a meth maker Hank is investigating. Walt uses student records to track down Jesse, his former pupil, now aged 23, and blackmails Jesse into letting Walt "cook" in the production side of Jesse's illegal drug trade. Walt plans to use his knowledge of chemistry to cook potent meth that Jesse will distribute, and he gives Jesse $7,000 to purchase a recreational vehicle (RV) which will be used as a rolling meth lab.[3] Jesse wastes most of the money while partying at a strip club, but one of his friends, Christian "Combo" Ortega, lets Jesse purchase his family's decrepit RV for $1,400.[6]
