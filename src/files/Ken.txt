Ken is a loud and obnoxious stock broker.

Ken is conned by Jimmy and Kim into buying them shots of expensive tequila. ("Switch").

Ken swiped Walter White's parking space in the Mesa Credit Union parking lot, all the while boasting into his Bluetooth headset and ignoring Walt.


Walt once again crossed paths with the obnoxious man talking on his Bluetooth headset outside of Danny's Auto Service gas station. When Ken walks into the gas station, bragging loudly into his Bluetooth headset, Walt shoves a squeegee between the battery terminals of the man's BMW (which has the license plate "KEN WINS"). As Walt walked back to his own car, the BMW burst into flames, much to Ken's shock and anger. ("Cancer Man")
