Holly White is the infant daughter of Walter and Skyler White. Walter White Jr. is her older brother.

Skyler is pregnant with her throughout the first two seasons of the show. That pregnancy was unintended.

While pregnant with Holly, Skyler smokes, much to Walt's displeasure when he finds out. ("Down") ("Breakage") They originally plan to deliver her via Caesarean section, however Skyler unexpectedly goes into labor and gives birth to Holly. Walt is not present during the birth of his daughter because he is preoccupied with drug related business; he blames Jesse Pinkman for making him miss the birth. Ted Beneke, Skyler's boss, is the one who takes her to the hospital when she goes into labor and stays with her until Walt finally arrives. ("Phoenix")
