Walter Hartwell "Walt" White Sr., also known by his clandestine pseudonym and business moniker Heisenberg, was an American drug kingpin. A former chemist and high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he started manufacturing crystal methamphetamine after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, in order to pay for his treatments and secure the financial future of his family: wife Skyler, son Walter Jr., and infant daughter Holly.

In the 1980s, Walt co-founded the company Gray Matter Technologies with his friend Elliott Schwartz and then-girlfriend Gretchen, but he left both Gray Matter and Gretchen soon after and sold his stake in the company for merely $5,000, while Gretchen and Elliott married and then went on to propel Gray Matter Technologies to becoming a multi-billion dollar business. Walt was never credited for his early work in the company, and resented them for it for years after. Walt eventually took up two jobs as both a high school chemistry teacher and a car wash employee in order to stay financially afloat. Eventually, though, he was diagnosed with lung cancer, and, fearing the idea of dying without leaving any money to his family, Walt began to search for other means of making money.

After joining his brother-in-law and accomplished DEA agent Hank Schrader on a drug bust and hearing from Hank about the lucrative profits that drug manufacturing and dealing could produce, Walt decided to use his knowledge of chemistry to become involved in the drug trade as a chemist and manufacturer in order to settle his financial woes and leave money behind for his family. Knowing nothing about the drug trade, he enlisted the aid of his former student, Jesse Pinkman, to help manufacture and, more importantly, sell his meth. Walt, by means of a P2P cook utilizing methylamine, produced methamphetamine of unrivaled chemical purity and a distinctive blue color, which was christened "Blue Sky" by dealers and users alike and which instantly began to dominate the market thanks to its potency.

While initially heavily reluctant to use violence, Walt gradually came to see it as a necessity, and eventually developed into a ruthless drug lord motivated largely by vanity, ego, and greed. At the beginning of his new career, he and Jesse made mere thousands of dollars through street dealing, and were constantly met with failure. Following multiple tense, deadly partnerships with distributors Tuco Salamanca and Gustavo Fring that ended in their respective deaths, however, and with the help of Jesse, Gus's former enforcer Mike Ehrmantraut, and Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, Walt eventually became the head of his own drug empire: the largest methamphetamine manufacturing operation in US history, branching as far as Eastern Europe, and enlisting Skyler to help him launder the profits.
