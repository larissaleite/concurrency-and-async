Cynthia is the manager of Los Pollos Hermanos, Albuquerque.

Walter White asks her the name of the manager that he met with previously and she informed him that he was actually the owner Gustavo Fring. ("Mandala")

When she sees The Cousins sitting in a booth without paying she tells them that it’s only for paying customers, but Gus tells her that he’ll handle it. He assures her that they did nothing wrong. ("Sunset")

When Walt storms to the restaurant he demands to speak to Gus but Cynthia tells him he’s not there and he doesn’t believe her. He tells her that he saw Gus’s car there. ("Shotgun")
