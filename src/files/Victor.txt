30's (Breaking Bad)
Victor was a loyal henchman of Gustavo Fring and a prominent enforcer in Gus' Drug Empire, alongside Mike Ehrmantraut. He was ultimately murdered by his boss after witnesses saw him at the scene of Gale Boetticher's murder.

While Mike is staking out Los Pollos Hermanos from across the street, he sees Victor drive into the restaurant and park out back. A moment later, he drives off, carrying Mike's tracker. Mike follows Victor's Escalade out into the desert, until he finds his tracker abandoned in the road, with a gas cap and a ringing cell phone. ("Witness") Victor and Tyrus Kitt are shown to be co-enforcers who serve as Gus's muscle while Gus speaks with Mike.

After Hector Salamanca's stroke, Victor follows Nacho Varga and witnesses him dumping Hector's doctored pills into the river. ("Smoke")
