Eduardo "Lalo" Salamanca is a member of the Juárez Cartel and is the grandson of Abuelita, the nephew of Don Hector Salamanca and the cousin of Tuco, Marco, Leonel and Joaquin.

After his uncle was put out of commission due to his stroke, Lalo took his position at El Michoacáno. He aimed towards stripping down Gustavo Fring's Drug Empire, which initiated a battle between him and the empire. After surviving an assassination attempt orchestrated by Gus, Lalo sets off for revenge against him and Nacho Varga, whom he discovered betrayed him.

Lalo was born in Mexico and was raised by his uncle, Hector, as an enforcer of the Juárez Cartel like his cousins Tuco, Leonel, Marco, and Joaquin. Like his uncle, he is a sadistic murderer and once assisted his uncle in torturing a hotel proprietor for disrespecting the two of them and burning the proprietor to death and his hotel down, keeping a desk bell as a souvenir of the ordeal.

Nacho Varga meets Lalo.
