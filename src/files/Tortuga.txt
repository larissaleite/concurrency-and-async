"Tortuga" (literally "Tortoise" in English) was a Cartel drug runner who worked for Juan Bolsa. He was also secretly a criminal informant to the DEA in El Paso about the inner workings of the Cartel.

He would ultimately be murdered by The Cousins on the orders of Juan Bolsa for his betrayal of the Cartel. 


When Los Cuates de Sinaloa is singing, Negro y Azul, there are little scenes where you can see Tortuga during the parts of the song when it mentions the cartel.
