Jack Welker was the leader of a criminal group with white supremacist or neo-Nazi ideologies. His nephew Todd Alquist (who refers to him as "Uncle Jack") was an associate of drug distributor Walter White. At Walt's behest, Jack arranged the murder of ten prison inmates, and later personally took part in the murder of Declan and his associates at the instruction of Lydia Rodarte-Quayle.

His gang later shoots and kills Steven Gomez during an intense gunfight after being called by Walt to come and kill Jesse Pinkman and minutes later Jack personally murders Hank Schrader with a gunshot to the head and takes the majority of Walt's drug money for himself. He also takes Jesse hostage at his nephew's behest and uses him to produce Blue Sky as a slave meth-cook.

This eventually turns his gang into the most profitable and powerful drug distribution operation in the Southwest while also working in league with Lydia. He is ultimately killed by Walt after he kills Jack's entire gang for revenge for his murder of Hank and Gomez.

Jack became the leader of a violent gang at one point in his life. His gang was heavily armed with military grade weaponry and equipment and acted as assassins for hire. Incarcerated members of his gang continued to operate as assassins to kill targets incarnated in prisons alongside them.
