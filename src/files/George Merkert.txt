George Merkert was the Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) of the Albuquerque DEA Field Office, serving as the boss for Agents Hank Schrader and Steven Gomez. He is impressed with Hank's work hunting down Tuco Salamanca and recommends him for a transfer to Tri-State Border Interdiction Task Force.

Because of his close personal friendship with Gustavo Fring and Fring's history as a generous philanthropist and public booster for the DEA, he was skeptical of Hank's notion that Fring might be involved with the criminal drug trade. After Hank's theories were revealed to be true by the discovery of Gus' Drug Empire and Gus' kingpin status, George Merkert lost his job.

Merkert became ASAC of the DEA Albuquerque at some point in his life. He has a wife named Kathy and a son and daughter. He was good friends with Gustavo Fring and once even had him over to his home for the Fourth of July. Merkert was completely unaware that Fring was one of the most powerful meth distributors in the Southwest and was operating right under his nose.

Merkert and SAC Ramey debriefed Hank after the shooting of Tuco Salamanca. ("Bit by a Dead Bee")
