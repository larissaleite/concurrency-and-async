Donald Margolis is the father of Jane Margolis. He originally worked as an air traffic controller and rented out the house beside Jane's.

Shortly after her death from a heroin overdose, Donald, still traumatized and distracted by her loss, returned to his job. Distracted and unable to concentrate due to her death, he accidentally failed to stop two aircraft from colliding with each other, leading to the Wayfarer 515 disaster, causing the deaths of 167 people.

He is revealed to have shot himself shortly after, and his status remains undisclosed.

Donald had a daughter, Jane Margolis, in 1982. He sent Jane to rehab once before and went with her to recovery meetings.
