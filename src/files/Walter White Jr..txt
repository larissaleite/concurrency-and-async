Walter Hartwell "Flynn" White Jr. is Walter and Skyler's seventeen year-old son, and the older brother of Holly. He attends J. P. Wynne High School, where his father used to work as a high school chemistry teacher.

Walter Jr was born with cerebral palsy, manifested in speech difficulties and impaired motor control, for which he uses crutches. He grows apart from Walt due to his father's absences and bizarre behavior, being taught to drive, for the most part, by his friends and going through a phase in which he preferred to be called "Flynn."
