Andrea Cantillo was the mother of Brock Cantillo and a recovering addict who entered into a relationship with Jesse Pinkman.

She would ultimately be murdered by Todd Alquist as punishment after Jesse attempted to escape from his uncle's compound and his refusal to cook meth for his gang anymore.

Jesse met Andrea in a Narcotics Anonymous while he was trying to push the blue meth he stole from Gus's superlab. Andrea was the single mother of a six-year-old boy, Brock. She also had a 11-year-old brother Tomás, though the two were estranged. Andrea later revealed unknowingly to Jesse that Tomás killed Combo ("Abiquiú"). A couple of days later, after a series of events involving the Rival Dealers, Tomás was found shot dead ("Half Measures").

After finding out about Tomás' death, she received a handful of cash in her mailbox from Jesse, who wanted her to use the money to move to a better neighborhood instead of buying drugs ("Thirty-Eight Snub"). She did and found a modest home for herself and Brock in a nice neighborhood ("Hermanos").
