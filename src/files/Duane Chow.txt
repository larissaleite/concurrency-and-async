Duane Chow, always referred to as Chow, was the owner of Golden Moth Chemical, an industrial chemical manufacturing company that supplies chemicals to Gus Fring's drug manufacturing organization. He received shipments of methamphetamine precursor, methylamine from Madrigal Electromotive.

Mike Ehrmantraut tracks him down to the building and shoots him in the hand as a consequence for hesitating to inform Gustavo Fring that he was being held hostage by the Juárez Cartel. ("Full Measure")

Months later, he is interviewed by the DEA for his involvement with Gus' drug empire. No sooner is he captured by another of Gus' employees named Chris Mara and forced at gunpoint to call Mike. After he calls Mike, he is ordered to sit on the couch, and is shot in the head. His death would be avenged by Mike shortly afterwards when he kills Chris by shooting him to death. ("Madrigal")
