Gustavo "Gus" Fring was a Chilean-born Albuquerque restaurateur, drug boss, business magnate, and philanthropist. He was the respected proprietor of Los Pollos Hermanos, a highly successful restaurant chain. However, despite outward appearances, Gus was a major drug kingpin initially affiliated with a Mexican drug cartel, secretly using his restaurant as a legitimate front for methamphetamine distribution throughout the American southwest. Gus was a criminal who "hid in plain sight", using his anti-drug philanthropy to conceal his true nature and build his illicit drug empire step by step.   

Gus collaborated with the Cartel solely to sabotage and destroy it for revenge for the murder of his close associate Maximino Arciniega and to allow his operation to control the meth market solely in the southwest, which he finally succeeded at by poisoning the entire Cartel hierarchy. In particular, Gustavo sought to torture and punish Hector Salamanca the most, as it was he who personally murdered Max. To achieve this Gustavo succeeded at sabotaging Hector's operations north of the border and systematically exterminate the majority of his family members while personally tormenting Hector for his own enjoyment.  

When Walter White seeks a buyer for his chemically pure meth, he is put in contact with Gus through Saul Goodman. Walt manages to persuade Gus into purchasing thirty-eight pounds of his meth for $1.2 million; after the product yields good returns, Gus offers Walt $3 million for three months of his time. Gus' hiring and protection of Walt puts him at odds with the cartel's leadership. Despite Gus' initial protection of Walt, the collaboration between the two men becomes permanently strained after he attempts to kill Walter for killing two of his dealers and after Jesse kills Gale on Walter's orders.

Despite being one step ahead of Walter at every turn and predicting every one of his attempts to kill him, Gus did have one weakness: his unbridled hatred for Hector. Ultimately Walter discovers and exploits this weakness, delivering an explosive device to Hector who later commits a murder-suicide to kill Gus with it.
