Skyler "Sky" White (née Lambert) is the widow of Walter White and the sister of Marie Schrader. She and Walter have a teenage son, Walter White Jr., and an infant daughter, Holly White. Skyler cares for Walter very much, but their marriage becomes increasingly strained due to his unexplained absences and bizarre behavior, ultimately leading to their separation.

When Walter reveals his involvement in the meth business, she initially seeks a divorce but ultimately ends up aiding him in laundering his illicit funds. At Skyler's behest, the Whites eventually procure the A1A Car Wash where Walter was previously employeed. As Walter slowly becomes more of a "hardened criminal," she becomes increasingly frightened for her and her children's safety, attempting to get Walt Jr. and Holly as far away from their father as possible. Sensing that injuries her brother-in-law Hank Schrader suffered in a drug-related shootout are connected to Walt's activities, Skyler offers to pay for his medical bills, explaining to Marie that Walt won a lot of money playing illegal card games. Knowing that Hank would never accept charity, the sisters agree not to tell him that the Whites are augmenting his insurance.
