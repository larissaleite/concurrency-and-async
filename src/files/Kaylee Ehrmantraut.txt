Kaylee Ehrmantraut is Mike Ehrmantraut's granddaughter, and the daughter of Matt Ehrmantraut and Stacey Ehrmantraut.

Mike visits her house and pushes Kaylee on a swing set. He takes a break to make small talk with Stacey, who seems to be keeping him at a distance. When she asks how long he’s planning to be in town, Mike tells her that he's going to stay indefinitely, to help out her and Kaylee. ("Five-O")

Hector Salamanca sends Leonel and Marco Salamanca to threaten Kaylee while Mike is supervising her. Fed up, Mike confronts Hector, negotiating a better offer of $50,000 in exchange for taking the fall on the Tuco gun charge.

Mike finishes his final shift at the parking booth and plays with Kaylee in his backyard. He tells Stacey that his new job has more flexible hours, allowing him to pick up Kaylee on a regular basis.

Mike becomes alienated from his family when he loses his temper with Kaylee, due to her talking about Matty and the "bad guys" that killed him. This leads Stacey to ask Mike to keep his distance. Later on, Mike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is over the recent events that angered him.
