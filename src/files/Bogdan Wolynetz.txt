Bogdan Wolynetz was the Romanian proprietor of the A1A Car Wash in Albuquerque where Walter White previously worked part-time.

Born in Romania, Bogdan moved to the United States at some point and invested in a car wash business. Bogdan consistently wound up understaffed, so Walter, although only hired to be a cashier, often found himself out scrubbing cars as well. Bogdan is Walter's non criminal nemesis.

Bogdan at the car wash while Walt was employed ("Pilot")
Walt continues to work for Bogdan at the car wash until he suddenly collapses and is taken away from the ambulance, where he discovers that he is diagnosed with Lung Cancer. After his cancer diagnosis, however, Walt quits, making a huge scene and telling Bogdan to "Wipe down this!" while grabbing his crotch. ("Pilot")
