Emilio Koyama was Jesse Pinkman's former partner in the meth business and the cousin and right-hand man of Krazy-8.

He would ultimately be killed by Walter White. His body would later be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid in Jesse's bathtub.

According to Jesse, they met when they were still in elementary school.

Jesse mentions that Saul Goodman provided Emilio legal representation on at least two occasions, getting him acquitted both times despite much evidence against him ("Better Call Saul"). According to a mugshot which Hank has in an evidence file, one of his arrests occurred on November 8, 2002.("Cancer Man")
