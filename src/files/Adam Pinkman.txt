Adam Pinkman is the father of Jesse Pinkman and Jake Pinkman, and the husband of Diane Pinkman. Unlike his wife who initially still shows care for Jesse, it is evident that Adam severely despises his son for his involvement with drugs and wants little-to-no involvement with him.

He reappears in El Camino where he and Diane urge their son to turn himself in, Adam's behavior suggesting that he cares for Jesse more than he ever let show before.

Adam and Diane were married at some point in their lives and the two have two sons, Jesse and Jake. Jesse was a poor student and a drug user and eventually became a drug dealer, something Adam and his wife strongly opposed. After the death of Jesse's aunt Ginny, Jesse was allowed to live in her home, possibly because the Pinkmans wanted him out of their home. It is clear by the start of the series that Adam has lost all hope for his son and simply wants nothing to do with him.

Adam appears to be very proud of his younger son, Jake, and it is possible he has done everything in his power to make sure he doesn't turn out like Jesse.
