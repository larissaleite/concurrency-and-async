Juan Bolsa was a high-ranking member and co-founder of the Juárez Cartel. Bolsa is the one that orders Tortuga's execution by Marco and Leonel Salamanca, and later places his head on a explosive-rigged tortoise for the DEA to find.

Bolsa also acts as the cartel's liaison with Gustavo Fring, and is the one who arranges a meeting between Gus and the Salamanca Family (Marco, Leonel, and Hector) on the matter of Walter White.

Bolsa was ultimately killed by Mexican Federales following the failed assassination of DEA Agent Hank Schrader. Bolsa's death was orchestrated by Fring, who sanctioned the hit on Schrader and arranged Bolsa's murder by the authorities as a ploy to hide his own role in Schrader's failed assassination from the cartel.

Bolsa was one of the founding members of the Juárez cartel and a close ally to Don Eladio and Hector Salamanca. His brother is a police chief.
