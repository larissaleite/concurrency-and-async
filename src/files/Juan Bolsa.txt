Juan Bolsa was a high-ranking member of the cartel which the Salamanca family belongs to. It is Bolsa who is the one that orders Tortuga's execution by Marco and Leonel Salamanca, and later places his head on a explosive rigged tortoise for the DEA to find.

He is also the cartel's liaison with Gustavo Fring, and is the one who arranges a meeting between Gus and the Salamanca Family (Marco, Leonel, and Hector) on the matter of Walter White.

After secretly sanctioning a hit on DEA Agent Hank Schrader in order to turn the American government against the cartel, Fring would ultimately get Bolsa murdered by Federales to cover his own role in the failed assassination. 

Bolsa was one of the founding members of the Juárez cartel and a close ally to Don Eladio and Hector Salamanca. His brother is a police chief.
