Clovis is Badger's cousin who operates a vehicle towing and repair service.

When Jesse Pinkman quits running with the RV, Clovis charges him an exorbitant amount to tow and store the vehicle, due to its cargo.

Clovis repaired the RV and later caught Jesse sleeping in it after Jesse had scaled the fence (and destroyed a portable toilet in the process) after being evicted from his home. Clovis ordered Jesse to pay for the repairs and property damage and then threatened to sell off Jesse's inventory to cover the repairs when Jesse claimed he could not furnish immediate payment. Jesse again broke into the gated lot and drove through the gate without paying for the repairs. He later returned to pay Clovis for the repairs and damages and made arrangements to store the RV inside Clovis' gated lot for $500 per week. Clovis also sold Jesse a used red  Toyota Tercel.

Jesse eventually decided to retrieve the RV, but Walter had warned Clovis that the DEA was looking for it, forcing Clovis to bring it to a junkyard (belonging to Old Joe) to be destroyed.
