Jane Margolis was a tattoo artist and Jesse Pinkman's neighbor, landlord and girlfriend. She was also a recovering drug addict and the daughter of Donald Margolis, an air-traffic controller.

Jane rents Jesse the duplex apartment next to hers after he tells her his parents kicked him out of his house, and the two fall in love quickly. When Jesse offers Jane a joint, she refuses, revealing that she's in recovery. But she later joins him as he smokes crystal to ease his guilt after his dealer and friend Combo is killed by rival dealers. From there, Jane turns Jesse on to meth and heroin speedballs, causing him to miss Walter White's meth deal with Gustavo Fring. She then blackmails Walt for Jesse's share of the profits.

Jane died of a Heroin overdose while living with Jesse when the two began using the drug, which Walt witnessed, but refused to intervene in. Her death ultimately played a role in the crash of Wayfarer 515, as her father was unable to properly do his job due to his grief over his loss.

Jane was born on April 4, 1982 in Phoenix, Arizona.
