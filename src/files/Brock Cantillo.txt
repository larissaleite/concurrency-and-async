Brock Cantillo is Andrea Cantillo's six-year old son and Tomás Cantillo's nephew.

Andrea, Brock, and Jesse eating.
Jesse Pinkman first meets Andrea at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting hosted by a church in which his original intention was to sell her some methamphetamine. However, after finding she is a mother of a six-year old son named Brock, he decides against it. Instead, he starts a relationship with Andrea and becomes friends with Brock ("Abiquiú"). 

Thanks to financial support from Jesse, Andrea and Brock can afford to move to a better house and leave the violent neighborhood in which they lived. ("Thirty-Eight Snub") Jesse was away from them, but still frequently sent money through Saul Goodman so that they could have a good life ("Hermanos").

Sometime later, Jesse reunites with Andrea and plays video games like Sonic Racers with her and Brock. Walt catches a glimpse of him when he arrives begging Jesse for help against Gus. ("Crawl Space") Soon after, Brock is rushed to the hospital after he suddenly becomes ill by some unknown cause. Jesse suspects that he'd been poisoned with the ricin that he had concealed in his pack of cigarettes, which was originally intended for Gustavo Fring. Jesse seeks Walter White, thinking he was responsible for ricin poisoning, but Walt leads Jesse to think that Gus poisoned Brock. Walt succeeds in turning Jesse against Gus at that moment, despite the fact that the two's relationship had been improving up to that point. ("End Times").
