Steven "Steve" Gomez was Hank Schrader's partner at the Albuquerque DEA office, as well as his close friend. He had a wife named Blanca Gomez. A mellow, by-the-book foil to Hank's over the top, strikeforce flair, Gomez reluctantly developed leads with Hank on the investigations into Heisenberg, Gustavo Fring's empire, and the notorious "blue sky" meth. Being of a Latino background, he had a little more knowledge about the inner workings of Mexican gangs than Hank. 

Gomez assisted Hank with trying to bringing Walt to justice once and for all, with the help of Jesse Pinkman. Gomez and Hank nearly succeeded in this task before eventually getting caught up in an intense gunfight with Jack Welker's Gang, which ended with Gomez being killed shortly before Hank was shot in the head by Jack. 

According to one of the trailers for El Camino, Gomez was born in 1971. He befriended Hank Schrader after he joined the Drug Enforcement Administration in the 1980s.
