Carmen Molina is the principal of J. P. Wynne High School.

Carmen attended the surprise party for Walter White's 50th birthday. She talked to Skyler about her pregnancy and met Marie Schrader for the first time. ("Pilot")

Carmen is later introduced as an assistant principal.

While Walt is on sick leave to undergo chemotherapy, he attends a meeting of faculty and parents at her request to discuss the arrest of a school janitor in connection with the theft of chemistry equipment from Walt's lab.

On his first day back from leave, Carmen says she prefers his new bald-headed look, and that he should feel comfortable coming to her if he's having any problems. After the Wayfarer Flight 515 disaster, Carmen calls a school assembly for students to discuss their feelings. Walt fidgets while students discuss the devastation, at one point grumbling "Jesus H. Christ." Hearing this, Carmen encourages Walt to express himself.
